NAME
    OpenVZ - Base class for OpenVZ utilities like vzctl

VERSION
      This document describes v0.01 of OpenVZ - released April 17, 2012 as part of OpenVZ.

SYNOPSIS
      use parent 'OpenVZ';

      #XXX: need to add more examples

DESCRIPTION
    This is a base class for OpenVZ utilities like vzctl and vzlist. It
    shouldn't be used generally outside of this framework.

FUNCTIONS
  new
    If you prefer an object oriented interface then just "use
    OpenVZ::submodule" and call the new function. All of the following
    functions will be available as methods.

      $vzctl = OpenVZ::vzctl->new;
      $vzctl->set({ ctid => 101, name => 'user101', save => '' });

  execute
    This function should not be called directly unless you know what you're
    doing.

    "execute" uses IPC::Run3::Simple's "run3" function to make system calls.
    "run3" returns whatever is sent to STDOUT, STDERR and the exit value as
    well as the execution time of the system call.

    This function is the workhorse of this package. It expects the following
    parameters as a hashref

      command => program name to be called (e.g., vzctl) (STRING)
      params  => parameters to be passed to the command to be called (ARRAYREF)

    "params" is optional.

    The params value will not be checked for validity. It is assumed that if
    you are calling this subroutine you have already validated whatever is
    going to be passed on the command line.

INSTALLATION
    See perlmodinstall for information and options on installing Perl
    modules.
